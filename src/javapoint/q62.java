//What is composition Holding the reference of a class within some other class is known as composition.
// When an object contains the other object, if the contained object cannot exist without the existence of container
// object, then it is called composition.
// In other words, we can say that composition is the particular case of
// aggregation which represents a stronger relationship between two objects. Example: javapoint.A class contains students. javapoint.A student cannot exist without a class. There exists composition between class and students.
